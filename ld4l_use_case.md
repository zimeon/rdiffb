# LD4L RDF `diff` Use Case

Consider an example from the Cornell University Library catalog, say a first issue copy of the first edition of Darwin's [_"On the origin of species by means of natural selection"_](https://newcatalog.library.cornell.edu/catalog/3865148). The metadata for this instance is available in multiple formats, including:

  * [MARCXML](https://newcatalog.library.cornell.edu/catalog/3865148.marcxml)
  * [LD4L Bibframe](http://draft.ld4l.org/cornell/n11b00e77e06484c7.html)
